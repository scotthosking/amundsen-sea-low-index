The Amundsen Seas Low (ASL) is a highly dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. The position and strength of the ASL are crucial for understanding regional change over West Antarctica. 

This repository contains a python package (`asli`) which implements the ASL calculation methods described in [Hosking *et al.* (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143), as well as notebooks illustrating its usage.

## Usage

### Installation

We advise installing this package and its dependencies in a python virtual environment using a tool such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-python) (other virtual environment managers are available).

Install the package from GitHub using pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/scotthosking/amundsen-sea-low-index`

### Downloading data
Command-line utilities are provided as a convenient way to download the datasets required for this analysis.

+ `asli_data_lsm` downloads land-sea mask ERA5 data.
+ `asli_data_era5` downloads certain variables from ERA5, by default `mean_sea_level_pressure`.

The `--help` flags can be used to find out more information, e.g.

```sh
asli_data_lsm --help
```

Alternatively, using the python interface:

```py
from asli.data import get_land_sea_mask, get_era5_monthly

help(get_land_sea_mask)
...

help(get_era5_monthly)
...
```

### Running calculations
A command-line utility is also provided for performing the basic calculations, with a similar help flag:

```sh
asli_calc --help
```

Alternatively, using the python interface, import the package and create an instance of the `ASLICalculator` class, initialising with the locations of the land-sea mask and mean sea level pressure data:

```py
import asli
a = asli.ASLICalculator(data_dir="./data/", 
                   mask_filename="era5_lsm.nc",
                   msl_pattern="ERA5/monthly/era5_mean_sea_level_pressure_monthly_1988.nc"
                   )
```

then read in the data and perform the calculation:

```py
a.read_mask_data()
a.read_msl_data()
a.calculate()
```

### Outputting data as a csv file and plotting
Once the calculations are done, we can write out the dataframe to a csv file, providing the filename:

```py
a.to_csv('asl.csv')
```

Basic plots of the pressure fields and lows can be made using the `plot_region_all()` and `plot_region_year()` methods.

```py
a.plot_region_all()
```

### Getting help
Most of the package has docstrings in the source code, so try running `help()` on any of the functions, classes or their methods, e.g. `help(asli.ASLICalculator)`.
